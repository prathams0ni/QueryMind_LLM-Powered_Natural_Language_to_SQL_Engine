Unlike basic NL-to-SQL demos, QueryMind is designed as a complete system with real-world architectural considerations including:

- Dynamic multi-database discovery
- Schema-grounded prompt engineering
- Secure query execution layer
- Self-healing SQL correction loop
- Modular backend design
- Real-time visualization

The application directly connects to the MySQL server and automatically detects all available databases. Any database present in MySQL Workbench will appear in the UI without hardcoding.

Users can:

• Select any database  
• Explore available tables  
• View complete schema (columns + data types)  
• Ask questions in plain English  
• Generate SQL queries  
• Execute them safely  
• Automatically correct query errors  
• Visualize results instantly  

This system simulates how AI-powered analytics tools would function in a real enterprise environment.

## 🏗️ System Architecture Philosophy

QueryMind is not just a UI wrapper around an LLM. It implements:

### 1️⃣ Schema Grounding
The selected database schema is injected into the LLM prompt before SQL generation. This:

- Reduces hallucinations
- Improves JOIN accuracy
- Enables multi-table reasoning
- Increases execution success rate

### 2️⃣ Secure Execution Guard
Before executing generated SQL:

- Only SELECT statements are allowed
- Destructive operations (DELETE, UPDATE, DROP) are blocked
- Query is cleaned and validated

This ensures database safety.

### 3️⃣ Self-Healing SQL Engine
If a query fails:

1. The database error message is captured
2. Error + original query + schema are sent back to the LLM
3. A corrected query is generated
4. The system retries execution automatically

This creates a resilient AI-assisted query engine.

## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture

QueryMind follows a structured, multi-layer AI execution pipeline designed for safety, resilience, and schema grounding.

| Stage | Layer | Component | Responsibility | Key Output |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| 1 | User Interface Layer | Streamlit UI (`app.py`) | Captures user natural language input and selected database | User query + selected DB |
| 2 | Metadata Layer | `db.py` | Dynamically fetches databases, tables, and schema from MySQL | Structured schema metadata |
| 3 | Context Engineering Layer | `prompt_builder.py` | Injects schema + user question into structured LLM prompt | Schema-grounded prompt |
| 4 | AI Reasoning Layer | `llm.py` (Ollama + Mistral) | Converts natural language into SQL query | Generated SQL |
| 5 | Security Validation Layer | `executor.py` (Pre-check) | Validates SQL (SELECT-only guard, sanitization) | Safe executable SQL |
| 6 | Execution Layer | MySQL Connector | Executes validated SQL against selected database | Query result / error |
| 7 | Resilience Layer | Auto-Correction Loop | If error occurs → feeds error + schema back to LLM | Corrected SQL |
| 8 | Data Processing Layer | Pandas | Formats results into structured dataframe | Clean dataset |
| 9 | Visualization Layer | Streamlit Charts | Auto-detects numeric columns & generates visualization | Interactive chart |
| 10 | Presentation Layer | UI Rendering | Displays SQL, explanation (optional), result table, chart | Final user output |

---

## 🔁 Error Recovery Sub-Pipeline

When execution fails, QueryMind activates a secondary correction loop:

| Step | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Capture Error | MySQL execution error message is extracted |
| 2 | Context Packaging | Error + Original SQL + Schema bundled |
| 3 | Regeneration | Mistral generates corrected SQL |
| 4 | Re-validation | SELECT-only guard re-applied |
| 5 | Re-execution | Corrected query executed |
| 6 | Final Response | Success result or final error displayed |

This creates a **self-healing AI SQL engine**.

---

## 🧠 Layered Architectural Model

QueryMind follows a multi-layer architecture:

| Architecture Layer | Purpose |
|--------------------|---------|
| Presentation Layer | User interaction & UI |
| Metadata Layer | Schema discovery & grounding |
| AI Reasoning Layer | Natural language → SQL conversion |
| Security Layer | Query validation & safety |
| Execution Layer | Database interaction |
| Resilience Layer | Error correction loop |
| Analytics Layer | Result processing & visualization |

---

## 🔐 Security & Governance Controls

| Control | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Query Restriction | Only SELECT statements allowed |
| SQL Sanitization | Markdown & formatting cleaned before execution |
| Schema Grounding | Reduces hallucinated table references |
| Error Feedback Loop | Controlled retry mechanism |
| Local LLM Execution | No external API exposure |

---

## 📊 End-to-End Data Flow Summary

| Input | Transformation | Output |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| Natural Language | Schema-Grounded Prompt | SQL Query |
| SQL Query | Validation & Execution | Data Result |
| Data Result | Pandas Formatting | Structured Table |
| Structured Table | Auto Visualization | Chart Output |

## 🚀 Architectural Strengths

✔ Modular separation of concerns  
✔ AI reasoning isolated from execution layer  
✔ Built-in safety constraints  
✔ Automatic retry resilience  
✔ Dynamic database discovery  
✔ Local LLM inference (privacy-safe)

# 🔥 Engineering Insight

QueryMind is designed as a layered AI system rather than a simple LLM wrapper.

It combines:

- Prompt Engineering
- Secure Systems Design
- Database Metadata Abstraction
- Error-Driven Regeneration
- Real-Time Data Visualization

into a cohesive pipeline.

---

## 🧠 AI Model Details

Model Used: Mistral  
Runtime: Ollama  
Deployment: Local  

Why Local LLM?
- No API cost
- Full data privacy
- Fast inference
- Offline capability

---

## 🗂 Modular Architecture

The project follows a clean modular design:

• app.py – UI & orchestration  
• db.py – Database metadata retrieval  
• executor.py – Secure query execution layer  
• prompt_builder.py – Schema-aware prompt generation  
• llm.py – Ollama (Mistral) integration  
• config.py – Database configuration  

This separation improves maintainability and scalability.

---

## 📊 Real-World Applications

QueryMind can be extended into:

• AI-powered BI dashboards  
• Conversational analytics tools  
• Enterprise SQL copilots  
• Internal data exploration assistants  
• Educational SQL tutors

## 🚀 What Makes This Project Stand Out?

Most NL-to-SQL demos:
- Hardcode schema
- Lack safety guard
- Have no retry mechanism
- Do not handle real DB environments

QueryMind addresses these limitations and simulates a real-world AI SQL assistant system.
